## III. Discuss question
Is the layered design as shown above (II) reasonable? If not, how should it be revised?
The layered design shown in section II is generally reasonable as it separates concerns and organizes the system into distinct layers. However, there are a few considerations for potential revisions:
1. **Layer Responsibilities**: Ensure that each layer has a clear and distinct responsibility, should not contain business logic, and the presentation layer should not handle data storage.
2. **Communication Between Layers**: The presentation layer should only interact with the business logic layer through a defined interface, avoiding direct access to the data access layer.
